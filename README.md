# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
This project is a Power BI dashboard developed using customer and transaction datasets from a credit card company.
The goal of the project is to analyze customer demographics, spending behavior, revenue drivers, and transaction patterns, and present actionable insights in an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.

Established relationships between customer, transaction, and demographic tables.

DAX Measures

KPI cards summarizing Total Revenue, Total Income, and Total Transactions.

Calculated fields for Revenue by Category (Card Type, Job, Education, etc.).

Data Visualization

Line charts for Revenue trend on gender basis.

Slicers for filtering by Card Category, Gender, Income Group, and Quarter.

Applied formatting techniques such as displaying values in millions (M), consistent color coding, and tooltips for details.
